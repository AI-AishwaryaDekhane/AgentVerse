# My First Agent

This agent is a simple example designed to help you get started with agents.
It logs a greeting message every 15 seconds. The key concepts covered include:

- Creating an agent instance
- Using the `on_interval` decorator to run tasks periodically
- Accessing the agent's context to log messages
